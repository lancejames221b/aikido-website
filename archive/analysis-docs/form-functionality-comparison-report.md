## Conclusion

The original site has a fully functional, comprehensive form with robust validation and professional features, while the enhanced site has a modern, conversion-optimized design that is completely non-functional.

**Immediate Action Required**: The enhanced site form must be made functional before deployment, as the current implementation would result in lost leads and negative user experience.

**Recommended Approach**: Combine the best of both - implement the enhanced site's modern design and streamlined UX with the original site's functional validation and essential data collection features.

This hybrid approach would maximize both conversion rates and lead quality while maintaining the professional standards expected by potential Aikido students.
