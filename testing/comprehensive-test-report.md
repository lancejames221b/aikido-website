## Manual Testing Checklist (Recommended Next Steps)

Since automated browser testing encountered technical difficulties, the following manual tests should be completed:

### Visual Verification Tests
- [ ] **Desktop View (1280x800)**: Verify layout, styling, and responsiveness
- [ ] **Tablet View (768x1024)**: Test responsive breakpoints and mobile menu
- [ ] **Mobile View (375x667)**: Confirm mobile-first design principles
- [ ] **Large Screen (1920x1080)**: Ensure proper scaling on large displays

### Interactive Element Tests
- [ ] **Contact Form Submission**: Fill out and submit form with test data
- [ ] **Form Validation**: Test required field validation and error messages
- [ ] **Mobile Menu**: Test hamburger menu open/close functionality
- [ ] **Navigation Links**: Click through all internal navigation links
- [ ] **External Links**: Verify external links open in new tabs/windows

### Cross-Browser Compatibility Tests
- [ ] **Chrome**: Test in latest Chrome version
- [ ] **Firefox**: Test in latest Firefox version  
- [ ] **Safari**: Test in latest Safari version
- [ ] **Edge**: Test in latest Edge version (if applicable)

### Performance Tests
- [ ] **Page Load Speed**: Measure actual load times across different connections
- [ ] **Image Loading**: Verify all images load properly and efficiently
- [ ] **CSS/JS Loading**: Confirm no console errors or resource loading failures

### Accessibility Manual Tests
- [ ] **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab through entire page using only keyboard
- [ ] **Screen Reader**: Test with VoiceOver (macOS) or NVDA (Windows)
- [ ] **Color Contrast**: Verify adequate contrast ratios for all text

2. **Fix Form Labels**: Add proper labels to all form inputs for accessibility compliance
3. **Manual Testing**: Complete the manual testing checklist above

### Future Improvements
1. **Comprehensive Accessibility Audit**: Consider using axe-core or similar tools for full WCAG compliance
2. **Performance Optimization**: While load times are good, consider image optimization and lazy loading
3. **Browser Testing Automation**: Resolve Puppeteer connectivity issues for automated cross-browser testing
4. **User Testing**: Conduct user experience testing with actual potential students

## Technical Notes

### Testing Environment
- **Local Server**: http://localhost:3000 (running successfully)
