"In 2018, I faced the devastating loss of my teenage son, which left me utterly broken. During the Covid-19 quarantine, I turned inward, deeply practicing Zen Buddhism to find peace and healing. While it helped, I struggled with self-isolation and knew I needed to change. To push myself out of my comfort zone, I set a goal to practice martial arts regularly, rekindling a passion from my childhood.

I discovered Genshinkan Aikido, meaning 'the dojo of Original Source,' which offered the traditional and respectful environment I sought. Starting in November 2023, I was nervous but determined to embrace being a beginner again. The journey was challenging, counter-intuitive, and exactly what I needed.

Sensei Gary Wagener embodies a perfect blend of strictness and respect, making Aikido both fun and authentic. His adaptive teaching style, rooted in traditional Aikido, ensures each student‚Äôs growth. Sensei Wagener‚Äôs timely encouragement and heartfelt teaching have been instrumental in my progress, especially during times of self-doubt. His support extends beyond the dojo, helping me find training opportunities abroad and guiding me through test anxieties with simple yet effective reassurances.

Aikido at Genshinkan isn‚Äôt just a martial art; it‚Äôs a comprehensive practice that influences every aspect of life. It has helped me cope with ADHD, become more mindful in daily activities, and find new depths in my Zen practice. My wife has noticed positive changes, and I feel more present and aware.

The community at Genshinkan is diverse and welcoming, comprising film students, engineers, and professionals from various fields, all united by a shared love for Aikido. This cooperative spirit enhances the learning experience, free from ego and competition.

Genshinkan Aikido is a place where learning is a joy, and every moment of practice is rewarding. It has been pivotal in my healing journey, transforming how I respond to life‚Äôs challenges. If you seek a compassionate, impactful martial arts experience that aligns mind, body, and spirit, I highly recommend trying a class at Genshinkan Aikido. The practice of Aikido here, under Sensei Wagener‚Äôs guidance, emphasizes the importance of being present and finding yourself through embracing practice, and the fun of always learning something new through the little things."

"Aikido has truly changed my life in incredible ways. I arrived at it through a recommendation from a friend after joking that I was so angry at the time. I started taking classes here simply because it was across the street from my job, but I stayed because of the warmth, care, and sense of community I found. From my very first class, Wagener Sensei made me feel like I had arrived at the right place. I‚Äôm still just a few months in, but already I feel a deep connection.

Having had three back surgeries, I especially appreciate how Wagener Sensei has tailored my training and made me feel safe. He‚Äôs been incredibly supportive, and I genuinely use Aikido in my daily life to cultivate calm and resilience ‚Äî and, in one recent occasion, for self-defense.

I am deeply grateful for the exceptional teachings and the welcoming atmosphere of the dojo. Practicing here has helped me gain confidence, patience, and a much deeper understanding of myself ‚Äî and I know there‚Äôs much more to come! I highly recommend this wonderful dojo to anyone seeking to grow both physically and mentally in a kind, inspiring space. You‚Äôll not only learn Aikido but you might also forge lifelong friendships along the way."

"I recently visited for a seminar. While it was taught by another instructor, you can tell the love and devotion put in the space. The school embraces Japanese culture in a way that appreciates it, not appropriates it. Highly recommend for anyone who loves aikido and is visiting lower Manhattan.

Humility and attention to detail come to mind when I think of my first impression. The students here are very passionate and will happily share that passion with you. If you‚Äôre thinking about a trial, I would 10,000% do it."

"When I first decided to give Aikido a shot, I had another dojo in mind. I was quickly swayed to try Genshinkan after reading the many positive reviews and sincere comments from students. Now that I've been a student here myself for several months, I know I made the right choice, and I'm happy to leave my own words of encouragement for the next person who might be in the same boat as me.

The community here is great and a real highlight of the dojo. You will get to know your fellow students over time, which makes practice more productive and meaningful. They help create a positive, non-competitive atmosphere that you can thrive in.

The instructors of course have years of experience, and are clearly dedicated to the art and the growth of their students. No matter your skill level, they will help you reach your goals at a pace that's right for you. Sensei's approach is earnest, straightforward, and adaptable to a range of abilities. Sometimes he's even funny! üòÅ

I highly, highly recommend Genshinkan, and Aikido."

"I started going to this dojo about a year ago and I have been hooked ever since. The dojo is at the 3rd floor of an otherwise unremarkable building in East Village but as soon as I walked in, I was struck by the authenticity.

Their method of teaching aikido is simple and effective. Each class, you learn a technique from set up to execution. By the time you go to several classes, the techniques start to build off each other.

The instructors are extremely insightful and have had years of practice. Many of them are graduated students from when the dojo first began, which is an amazing testament to the school‚Äôs success. During each class, they observe each student‚Äôs technique and give personalized advice or make adjustments several times. The community is so supportive and many of the people I met here have become my closest friends.

I‚Äôm so thankful to everything Genshinkan Dojo has done for me. I give Genshinkan only 5 stars because I can‚Äôt give it more!"

"I have been training at Genshinkan for five years now. Obviously, I think that the school is excellent. Training is rigorous and the instruction is top notch. Wagener Sensei and the other instructors are committed to Aikido, and their honest dedication is inspirational. Aikido does not come easily or quickly. It takes time to learn the techniques and really get into how to move properly. (It takes a lifetime really.) The other students have always been very supportive. This is a school where we work together, so we can learn more and become better practitioners."

"If you are considering learning a martial art, I highly recommend aikido, and this dojo in particular. I am new to martial arts, and only recently begun taking aikido here, but I already feel I have benefited in many ways from the classes I have taken. The instruction you will receive is incredibly thoughtful, layered, and applicable in many ways to living in our complicated world. Somehow G. Wagener Sensei is often able to tailor instruction and feedback to each person‚Äôs body, learning style and level, while still challenging and engaging students at all levels. Assistant Dojo Cho Ariana also teaches classes and is able to break down techniques in a way that I feel as a beginner are particularly helpful. Students from all levels also attend each class, which gives beginners an opportunity to learn with and from many different types of people. Everyone I have encountered thus far has been incredibly welcoming, patient, kind, and eager to both learn and improve. The dojo is also a beautiful space to inhabit, with special attention paid to plants, the shomen (altar at the front of the room), and the library in the back of the space. If you are at all interested in connecting your mind and body to help you more fully participate in life, I encourage you to try aikido at this dojo."

"My daughter attends the Genshinkan's kids class and loves it. The student teacher ratio is incredible. There are about 1-2 instructors in addition to 1-2 assistants for each class. There are currently around 4 kids in the class.

My daughter wanted to try martial arts for a while and we went to a couple of trial classes at different dojos/studios and after the trial class here my daughter immediately wanted to sign up. The senseis are kind and patient and aren't just there to yell and intimidate the kids. They are also attentive to each student.

The owner Sensei Gary is very involved and invested in the growth of the students. What I really appreciated during the first class was when he saw my daughter's focus and dedication he told me that even if she ended up not choosing aikido at Genshinkan he would help me find another class for her. I also really appreciated that when we signed up I was told to just get a gi (uniform) from Amazon and not to spend too much money on it. All the other classes we tried out wanted us to purchase their overpriced gis. Coming here, you get the sense of being in a warm community of skilled experts who care about your children and want to train them well. You can tell they aren't after the money, they actually care about your child's development. We love being a part of this community and I love being able to see my small 7 year old flip a grown man twice her size. Can't recommend their kid's class highly enough."

"Been coming here for a month, it hasn't been long but I already can't see myself ever stopping. From the teachers down to the students everyone is very helpful and welcoming. The techniques are explained in detail and demonstrated with finesse. Sensei Wagener is very humble and funny yet direct when he needs to be. I look forward to my classes everyday and will continue coming in as much as I can. Know that if you decide to attend that you are in good hands."

"I began practicing aikido in Milan in 2018 and liked it so much that, when I had to move to New York, it was natural for me to look for a new dojo to continue my studies.

I liked Genshinkan Aikido from my first class, mostly because I felt the same warm energy that I had received in my former dojo (and also because it looked immediately an organized place), and I am glad that I chose to continue my practice here rather than elsewhere in town.

There are several reasons why I would suggest this dojo, but the students who are a part of it are the most important. Over the past year, I had to relearn what I thought I knew, both the basics and the more advanced techniques, and everyone was incredibly patient and generous with me, helping me both on and off the tatami. You get the impression that you're part of a community, and over time I've developed a sense of belonging that I never thought I'd experience again. I met several wonderful people who helped me far more than they can imagine.

All of this is thanks to the sensei. Although he might appear severe and harsh on occasion, he immediately gave me the impression of being a great teacher - which was later confirmed. He loves what he does and continuously encourages his students to be better and go beyond simple physical moves, but I would never describe him as hard. Yes, he is demanding, but that is to be expected when you put so much of yourself into teaching. Furthermore, he pays close attention to individual students, both in terms of aikido practice and otherwise, which makes being in the dojo even more beautiful."

"Joining Genshinkan Aikido Dojo has been a transformative experience in my life. The dojo is not just a place to learn martial arts; it's a sanctuary where growth and self-improvement are nurtured. Our sensei is not only exceptionally knowledgeable in Aikido but also possesses a profound ability to impart wisdom and skill to students of all levels.

What sets Genshinkan apart is its incredibly warm, welcoming, and supportive community. From day one, I felt like I belonged, and this sense of camaraderie has only grown stronger. The dojo practices an adaptive learning approach, ensuring that each session is tailored to match the individual's skill level. This personalized attention means that everyone, from beginners to advanced practitioners, is constantly challenged to excel without feeling overwhelmed.

Aikido, by its nature, is non-competitive, and this philosophy is deeply embedded in the ethos of Genshinkan. The focus is on personal growth and mastering the art, rather than competing against others. This creates a healthy, non-toxic environment where one can truly focus on self-improvement and physical and mental discipline.

I cannot recommend Genshinkan Aikido Dojo enough. It's more than just a dojo; it's a community and a way of life that encourages and supports you to become the best version of yourself."

"This place is a real gem. It would be hard to overstate the warmth of the community and the outstanding teaching. The sensei is a great educator who truly cares about his students. He is supportive and accommodating but simultaneously has high standards and will inspire you to improve continuously. He has an intuitive awareness of his students‚Äô needs and abilities to the point that sometimes I genuinely wonder whether he is reading my mind.

The students are a diverse group that includes a good amount of other women. Everyone is friendly, welcoming, and unpretentious. The dojo is also very responsive via email, so if you have any lingering questions before coming and trying your first class, head to the website and reach out!"

"The dojo is a true diamond: it's cared of with utmost passion and love. Everyone is treated with the same amount of respect, and we all work together to help each other thrive. No macho culture is allowed, and there is no place for prima-donna behavior.

The students are a fantastic lot; everyone is supportive, and no one ever judges. You're never made feel you're not enough or that you should do or be better. Training is a magic experience: the kind of contact you experience with your fellow students is something hard to come across anywhere else. You'll get to feel when someone's had a bad day, when they're tired, you'll sense if they're happy or nervous, and regardless of everything that happens in our daily lives, everyone always gives their very best.

Our Sensei: He has incredibly high standards and is totally and completely dedicated to this Art. He's an unfaltering inspiration for improvement, even when you think you can't make it, even when you drop the ball. He understands the skills, needs, and difficulties of each student and knows your limits better than yourself. He pours his heart into the dojo, and it shows.

It's not for you if: 1. You have a big ego. 2. You're looking to show off whatever superpower you think you might have.

It's for you if: You love learning. No matter how much or how little. Each class is a new lesson. Some classes will make you doubt your ability to discern left from right (been there‚Ä¶), while some others will put in perspective everything you thought you knew about your own body (done that).

What I've learned so far is that Aikido takes time, dedication, and patience, but mostly the humility to understand that it'll be an ever-lasting journey. If you're cool with that, you'll be in for an amazing ride!"

"I've always been intrigued to study a martial art, but I've never taken any type of formal training. I wanted to find the right one. Aikido was the best fit for me. The ideology of redirecting an attacker‚Äôs energy away from me without serious injury was what I was looking to learn however, I had reservations about starting not knowing what to expect. Honestly, the hardest part was getting myself to come to the first class but within the first 15 minutes I was hooked.

From the moment I walked in the door I could sense there was something special about this place. It truly is a hidden gem in the middle of a bustling city. Everyone in the dojo is warm, instantly welcoming and happy to explain the practice. All the teachers have a very expansive knowledge-base and are wonderful at demonstrating and guiding students through each technique.

Classes are open to all levels, which is great. I've never thought 'oh, this class is too advanced, when is the beginners class'. They teach you at your speed regardless of whoever else attends. The teachers reinforce proper etiquette, respect for everyone and how to practice Aikido in a safe and joyful way.

I am grateful that I've discovered this place. If you're looking to learn Aikido in NYC, this is THE dojo."

"I was recommended by a friend to try out Aikido at Zenshinkai. I have practiced and experienced other martial arts before, but I was a complete beginner to Aikido. I was excited but also anxious for the first class. Upon entering the dojo, any feeling of anxiousness that I had before completely dissipated. I was greeted by two students of the dojo. They were extremely warm and welcoming and more than willing to answer any questions I had. Every student I was paired with throughout my first class was extremely patient and very helpful. Wagener Sensei walked the room and would step in and help everyone while they were practicing. I took notice that the atmosphere of the class was extremely peaceful, and contained no edge of competitiveness. I thoroughly enjoyed my first class and when it ended my first thought was I can't wait to come back! I have been at the dojo for a month now and feel extremely privileged to be able to practice with such dedicated, and compassionate individuals. If you have been searching for a martial arts school, or want to try something new, I strongly recommend this school."

"I was looking to get into Zen when a friend advised me to consider Aikido instead. It was a surprising suggestion taking into account that Aikido is a martial art. But when I discovered that 'Aikido' literally translates to 'the way of harmonious spirit', I was really intrigued to find out more about it. I didn‚Äôt have much prior experience with any martial art and in-fact Zenshinkai Aikido of Manhattan was the first (and last) school I visited, so I wasn‚Äôt quite sure what to expect.

Even before entering the dojo, I was welcomed by some of the students and was given the option of observing or participating in the class. I decided to participate and time just flew by in those 2 hours! The instructor, Wagener Sensei, took time to explain the basic techniques to me and the other two visitors. He also took time at the end of the class to demonstrate some of the more advanced techniques; it gave us a great idea of what Aikido looks like. Also, all the students here took extremely good care of me and the other beginners.

My friend had initially suggested me to look out for two things when picking a school:  
1) The school should teach the art the traditional way (instead of being commercially driven)  
2) The instructors should display personal interest in the growth of each student

Early on in the class, Wagener Sensei mentioned that the school is run in accordance with the tradition and etiquette followed by the Hombu Dojo in Tokyo. This was clearly visible in the class. Point #1: check!

Throughout the class, Wagener Sensei gave each student improvement suggestions (including us visitors!) in a very patient manner. After the class ended, he and many of the students came around and asked me about my experience and if I had any questions about the school and Aikido in general. Point #2: check!

Needless to say, I signed up right away and have been practicing here since. I‚Äôm surprised how Aikido has been making an amazing difference in my outlook towards life. The philosophy of creating harmony and compassion that underlies the art is a major draw that keeps me coming back. Also, what really speaks to me about Aikido is the grace and power of the movements. The fact that all the students take genuine interest in supporting each other's development creates a very special and focused atmosphere, particularly in a city as fast-paced as New York. As the name of the school suggests, it embodies Zen meditation as a part of practice. So there is a lot of focus on the holistic development of the students.

To conclude, anyone seeking to explore the connection between mind, body, and spirit in an exciting way will feel right at home here."

"I have been attending this Dojo for almost 4 months. This is my first time to practice martial arts. Instructors and student are very warm, welcoming, and supportive.

Particularly, I am a slow learner so that I always struggle to get Katas but everyone there is so patient to teach me. Once, I was the only person to not gain how to use Jo. I thought that okay and I would get it later. But, Sensei knew that I could not get it. So, Sensei showed the way and trained in person and meanwhile, the class was stopped for about 5 mins. I felt so bad to stop the class but I very appreciated the moment that sensei seriously took care of me and the other students cheered me up.

Always the senseis and advanced students encourage students to practice different katas and look after student very well. I strongly recommend person who considers to start Aikido to take a trial class in Genshinkan dojo.

Additionally, every class is serious but fun!"

"I started coming to ZAM about two months ago. I'd never done any kind of martial art before, but had always wanted to try. I'd been searching for a while for a dojo, but had never found one that felt right.

Basically as soon as I walked in, I noticed the atmosphere - friendly, relaxed, and welcoming. The guys and girls (yes, the dojo is roughly 50% women!!) I met are all very kind and eager to share the art of Aikido. I've found that it's a wonderful place to learn and to make mistakes, as everyone is very supportive and will help walk you through the tricky movements, no matter if they are an instructor, high ranking student, or a fellow beginner.

Though everyone is so friendly and there may be a lot of joking around in the downtime before or after class, the actual instruction and practice is taken very seriously. Proper etiquette is emphasized, as is the real risk of injury that comes with improperly performed technique. Wagener Sensei will often remind the students to 'take care of each other,' as overly eager or overly aggressive movements might result in injury. There is a great respect for the art and for those who practice it in the dojo.

Aikido itself is a challenging discipline. The challenge doesn't come from competition, as Aikido is not about besting or defeating an opponent. It comes from learning to link your mind and body through movement and breath... while someone is coming at you. Aikido is as much a challenge for the mind as it is for the body. I have found that increasingly its principles and theories are blending over into my non-dojo life; I am more patient but more confident, for starters.

Wagener Sensei has created a supportive and caring, but at the same time, serious and hard-working community. I consider myself very lucky to have found this dojo."

"I practiced aikido many years ago and decided to start it again. I looked around and had a few choices in Manhattan. I came for a trial class here at Genshinkan dojo and felt the connection with the place. Folks here are drama free and pretty comfortable to be with. The dojocho (Wagener Sensei):  
- has individual approach for every student  
- makes the classes fun  
- makes sure students are satisfied with the practice  
- puts a high priority on the cleanliness and maintenance of the space

The dojo is blessed with other aikido instructors, who are also knowledgeable and cordial.

It has been four months and I am very grateful for the chance to be a part of Genshinkan."

"For ten years I wanted to learn Aikido. Not just any martial art. Aikido. The idea of transferring energy directed at you without having to be big or strong has always seemed like the ultimate way of defense. I did not have the means in my life to start until this year (I actually started on New Year's Day) and I am so happy and grateful that I found this dojo with Wagener Sensei and the students here.

Although there is much diversity among the students, everyone‚Äôs character is essentially the same: welcoming with warm hearts, without ego or judgement. The same is true of Wagener Sensei. He is a wonderful teacher and his sense of humor keeps classes fun and memorable. Wagener Sensei and the students have made my ten year delay in learning Aikido all worth it.

I encourage you to come and watch or better yet, come for a trial class and see if this dojo is a fit. That‚Äôs how I started. Although I practiced Taekwondo as a child, you do not need to have any experience with martial arts to begin. You can try a class and see how you like Wagener Sensi and the students. There are no hidden or contract fees. If you have the means, begin now."

"Before my first class at this dojo, I was on the fence about joining, heck, I was on the fence about committing aikido (versus other martial arts like Jujitsu, judo, karate etc.). I was only slightly curious about Aikido, but my first class here gave me a great essence of this art form. The teacher here is humble, light hearted and makes learning enjoyable. His students are warm, welcoming and very supportive to any newcomers.

The teacher here does a great job incorporating the philosophy of aikido with the techniques we learn in the class. Along with self-defense, we are also taught how to harmonize with our physical and mental state, which I find to be extremely useful practice on and off the mat."

"I was recommended to the school by a coworker who has been attending the school since the beginning. I was unsure what to expect having never taken any form of martial arts previously, but was excited about the opportunity. I have now been a member of the ZAM for two months and have enjoyed every second of it.

The atmosphere in the dojo makes every class unique and a valuable opportunity to learn from sensei and the other aikidoka. The spirit of each student willing to help another learn and grow is admirable. There is a mutual respect among all students--regardless of time spent on the mat."

"I have been coming to the dojo for a month. I am having so much fun here!

Everyone is super friendly and always willing to help. Also, because of the Aikido culture, everyone in the dojo is humble, and not coming here for fight you.

I'm a slow learner, but it is fine here. Sensei and other students help me all the time with lots of patience.

I didn't think I would be keep coming to the dojo, because the dojo is super far away from where I live, and Sundays' classes are super early. However, nothing is a problem any more because I love practicing Aikido with these lovely people so much!"

"I started Aikido at the Zenshinkai dojo around 6 weeks ago and are very happy that I found this gem. Everyone is so supportive and patient and always willing to help. This is a group of great people and for me as a German it was an extra bonus to find 3 senior students that share my German language. I do like the meditative aspect combined with a good physical workout. There is so much to learn and Sensei Wagener is making it a joyful experience."

"This school has two distinct elements that make this an excellent place to train.

Wagener-sensei is knowledgeable yet humble - a combination that makes studying under him a pleasure.
Classes themselves have a heavy etiquette component that may seem daunting at first, I found the etiquette refreshing since I know at all times what is expected of me.

Instruction is serious yet lighthearted, a striking contradiction to find in any martial arts class. You're never made to feel bad if you aren't 'the best', and no one ever 'gives up' on you if you're struggling.

There is an air of seriousness to the way classes are conducted that may not be for everyone. However, people who are sincere in their training will find that they are taken seriously in turn. This seriousness comes from the fact that Aikido requires heavy amounts of concentration and focus. Most martial arts do - and aikido is possibly the most unforgiving when it comes to mental lapses.

Lastly, the other students. The first thing I noticed is that a large percentage of students take *every* class. Mo, We, Su. I then learned that for the lion's share of students at Genshinkan, Aikido is a sincere passion. There is a focus and love for the school and the style that is not accidental. There is a sincere culture of respect here for everyone. Students are always welcoming and everyone wants to help.

Genshinkan is an extremely unique dojo, and I am incredibly happy to be a part of it."

"If you‚Äôre not into my long winded response: If you‚Äôre thinking about trying Aikido at all, come here and try it. Even if it‚Äôs just once. You‚Äôll know if it‚Äôs the place for you. It just takes walking through the door and giving it a try.

Before I walked in the door, I was scared to start something new. I was scared that I was too old, and all that. I was scared to look stupid. It took a long time, but one day I finally decided that it was time to get over those fears. They all seemed so silly the minute I stepped inside.

Every student is there to help, and they make sure you feel that. The atmosphere of the dojo is friendly, supportive, encouraging and almost like a family. It‚Äôs inclusive of all kinds of people who are open to learning Aikido. Wagener Sensei and the other students are just wonderful people.

My journey with Aikido started when I did it for a short period when I was 6 or 7 years old, but I didn‚Äôt remember much. I stopped by 8. I‚Äôm 21 how, and I didn‚Äôt think much of Aikido after I ‚Äústopped‚Äù (took a long break?) until my third year of college, where I‚Äôve fallen in love with it. It‚Äôs an art, and I love learning it. I love how it flows, how simple but complex (and hard!) it is. I love the way it‚Äôs something people do together, a partnership, and I love the challenge. I love the life lessons it as to offer, and I love how beautiful it is.

Genshinkan Dojo as a whole, as well as Wegener Sensei, are dedicated to the art, and the students. This place is a real find. I‚Äôm young so I guess I can know for sure, I don‚Äôt think something like this just exists very often in a lifetime. It‚Äôs a good fit for me. I can‚Äôt explain it. But I love my time at Genshinkan Dojo. It‚Äôs gone beyond Aikido, friendships, and all that. It‚Äôs learning how to breathe.

All I know is that it‚Äôs right for me, because of the joy it brings. My words are all kind because it‚Äôs all I‚Äôve felt from it. Wagener Sensei challenges me to push myself, and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm very grateful for.

And of course, lastly, there‚Äôs Wagener Sensei‚Äôs sense of humor, which is like Aikido to me. The joy it brings is unexplainable. Obviously, Aikido training is taken very seriously, but like I said before, if brings joy. But either way it‚Äôs a gem that you‚Äôd have to experience, rather than me saying anything about it.

Bottom line, Aikido means so much to me and I‚Äôd never know if I never got over my fear and tried out a class all these years later."

"I can't say enough good things about this dojo!

Wagener Sensei is incredibly knowledgable, kind, generous, positive and clearly passionate about aikido. He made me feel so welcomed and his good energy is also present in all the students that attend.

Everyone at ZAM makes it easy to learn and really encourages you to do your best without creating a competitive environment. You will learn a lot about yourself and get a really great workout.

If you are thinking of trying out aikido, I can't recommend a better place.

Do yourself a favor and sign up today!!!"

"Expect to find the best environment to learn this amazing martial art. Sensei Wagner (Teacher) has a very practical and forward thinking approach to teaching, grounded in the present and keeping it lean from the unnecessary, while staying true to the philosophy and tradition.

In Aikido you learn from your Sensei (Teacher) as much as you learn from your fellow students and here you will find great people from all ranks. It doesn't matter who you practice with, you will learn something different and valuable every time you hit the mat.

The Dojo is the one you can see in the pictures, nice, humble, always clean and tidy. However, here you will find that Aikido is a practice that goes beyond the physical aspect, and even beyond the walls of the dojo. You will come to understand that Aikido is a philosophy that touches every aspect of life, that what you learn on the mat can have a very positive influence over your perspective and over how you choose to live it.

In short, in this Dojo you will find the essence of Aikido reflected in every aspect of it. So, if you are looking to practice a martial art based on Peace, Harmony and Compassion for the Mind, Body and Spirit, this is your place.

Hope to see you on the mat!"

"This is a great dojo--serious without being competitive. The focus is on technique and connection, both with your partner/opponent and with your own center and body. Watching Wagener Sensei and senior students demonstrate techniques is awe-inspiring. The method of teaching is different that I'm used to from other schools, and I find it much more understandable. You watch the technique demonstrated, then you partner up and do it. So even as a total Aikido beginner I have an idea of why I'm doing things and what I'm aiming for. If you are looking to study Aikido, this is a true dojo driven by a love for the art and desire to impart knowledge, rather than ego or plans to make piles of money. Plus, it's fun and the classes feel like a team rather than a competition. A real find!!"

"Prior to visiting Genshinkan Dojo, I had no experience with martial arts. It is an art, and this dojo is full of a collective pride, pride that encourages individual shine. The people are pleasant and tough - introverts unite! - and creates a space that demands presence each movement Gary moves us through. This is worth a look if you are in the LES - positive vibes here. The first class is complementary too :)"

"I've been attending classes at Zenshinkai for the last three months and I absolutely love it. Over the years, I'd tried various martial arts and yoga schools, but never really found a practice that I connected with and wanted to do on an ongoing basis.

That all changed the first time I came to Zenshinkai. I immediately felt welcomed by the warm atmosphere. Time flies by in every class and I always leave with a big smile on my face.

Much more than exercise or self-defense, the school is also about with helping you develop as a person. After attending my first class, I expected to be hit with a big pitch to join and buy a 'karate uniform.' Instead they told me 'Don't worry about a uniform or joining for now. Just keep coming to class if you like it. There's no contract or anything. If you like it and eventually decide you want to stick with it, it's $100 a month.' Twelve 2-hour classes per month of world-class, hands-on instruction for a hundred bucks is pretty much the best deal in Manhattan.

Each class begins and ends with a brief quote from Aikido's founder, Morihei Ueshiba. This one is one of my favorites: 'Your heart is full of fertile seeds, waiting to sprout.'

If you have any interest, call them and set up a time to come in and try a class. You won't regret it."

"Genshinkan Dojo offers serious Aikido training in a warm and welcoming environment. While devoted to a rigorous and traditional martial art, this Dojo is infused with compassion and often filled with laugher. Wagener Sensei (Dojo-Cho / Chief Instructor), the other instructors, and their dedicated students have built a true community of practice and learning. I highly recommend."

"Zenshinkai is a gem. With such a warm, welcoming environment, its impossible not to have a great experience. Whether its your first time, or you've been practicing aikido for years, Wagener Sensei conducts classes with respect and compassion. I'm definitely a happier person since making Zenshinkai my home dojo."

"I have been a student of ZAM since they first opened their doors and the most redeeming quality about the school is the openness to beginners. They are extremely patient and everyone is really helpful. No experience is necessary and they just want everyone to enjoy themselves while maintaining a seriousness about the art. I would highly recommend this school to anyone in search of a martial art or a mental/spiritual path."

"I was brand new to aikido when I walked onto the mat. I didn't know what to expect, other than that my friend had a strong passion for it. The atmosphere on the mat reflects my sense of wonderment at the techniques, a dedication to learning, and a respect for the community you've joined. All the while having a bit of what you worry is too much of a good time smiling."

"This dojo has become a grounding force that has nurtured growth on multiple levels. The tilting and listing that can occur in daily life through the hustling and bustling and constant thoughts has been mediated through the experience of physical techniques, breathing exercises, and 'in the moment awareness' philosophy; this is a Zen practice. The energy, charged with sincerity and purposefulness, from all, is an experience in and of itself. Aikido is intense as it is graceful; and though a Budo, gentle enough to facilitate a learn by doing approach, where anyone can 'jump in' and participate. Highly recommended to all, from any walk of life. If you have been searching for something with a little more depth and still want to be able to push your mind and body, and quite probably your spirit, walk up the steps and come visit ZAM. And bring some sweats, you can't make a mistake, you'll want to participate."

"This dojo houses the most welcoming and supportive group of people, who treat you like family. The people here, while dedicated to training, will never make you feel bad in any way. None of them are that kind of people. They will take care of you and they will teach you. They will stick by you until you get it. On the mat, all anybody wishes for each other, is to learn the art as best as we can. That's it. No competition. Just learning. This is a small dojo but is growing rapidly. I can actually see each of us getting better and better and stronger and stronger at each and every class.

Most of the members show up to almost every single class, which is extremely encouraging. And even though I am still fairly new to the dojo, it is exciting for me to keep seeing even newer people also keep coming back to every class. I am excited for the growth of this dojo. I also find that most students here are very talented.

Before each class, we set up the dojo by laying down the mats and wiping them down, and we put them away after each class. Oddly enough, I love this part of the class just as much as the training. It reminds me of Japan, where almost every days and deeds seem to begin and end with communal cleaning. I think it strengthens the bond between each of us and also with the dojo itself. I had missed that. But I can experience that here again. Honestly, I wouldn't want to learn budo without this.

And the training done here is in every bit as authentic as any dojo in Japan, with strong emphasis in community building, personal connections, spiritual growth, and technical mastery. Our sensei, Wagener Sensei really understands the spirit of this art and the tradition, and it is so inspiring to study under someone who embodies these qualities. There is not even an ounce of fakery here. His teaching style is a perfect mixture of, kindness, humor, and toughness. And as with everybody else in this dojo, he really cares about each of us and will go out of his way to help anyone that could use it.

This place is the epitome of what a good dojo should be. If you ever thought about starting Aikido, join us here. You will find yourself most welcome!"
