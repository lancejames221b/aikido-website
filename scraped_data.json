      "main": "Gary WagenerChief Instructor/Dojo-ChoGary Wagener Sensei is a Yondan (4th degree black belt) Aikikai, recognized by Hombu dojo in Japan. The centering and harmonious aspect of daily practice is what originally and continually draws Mr. Wagener to aikido. \"After training for some time students begin to notice their everyday movements change, their breathing changes, and their daily communication changes. This injection of focused harmony and budo spirit begin to manifest itself through the understanding of aikido.\" Mr. Wagener's goal as a practitioner and instructor is to help students understand the foundations and find joy in their training.In addition to his training and instructing at Genshinkan Aikido Dojo, Mr. Wagener has taught aikido programs to underprivileged children in New York Public Schools.Robert HoffInstructorRobert Hoff Sensei is a Yondan (4th degree black belt) Aikikai, recognized by Hombu dojo in Japan. Mr. Hoff began his aikido training in Brooklyn, New York, under the instruction of Joseph Jarman Sensei. It was following an intensive period in the practice of Zen Buddhism that he became initially attracted to the art. \u201cI began training shortly after my introduction to Zen. I found in aikido a more physical and ultimately fulfilling means to similar ends \u2013 thinking and acting with compassion, existing more in the moment, being less attached to the ultimately transient nature of being. Aikido necessitates that the practitioner be supremely present, and it\u2019s that reward that sustains my practice.\u201dIn addition to his experience teaching aikido to both young people and adults, Mr. Hoff is a history teacher at a K-12 public school in Manhattan.Ariana KoblitzInstructorAriana Koblitz is a Nidan (second-degree black belt)  Aikikai, recognized by Hombu dojo in Japan.  Mrs. Koblitz joined the dojo when she first moved to New York. Training the heart, mind, and body at Genshinkan quickly became a strong base to build up from amidst the constant shifts and pivots necessary living in NYC.Each class presents a lesson she had not realized she needed that day: a nuance in body movement, posture, a clarity of mind.Ariana celebrates the principles she discovers on the mat. Be present and focus on your partner, move in harmony with them because you are both aiming for a shared outcome of peace, react only to what is presented to you with the techniques you are slowly adding to your toolbox. These provide endless inspiration for her work in experience design.Sarah AntalInstructorDojo- Cho, Genshinkan White PlainsSarah Antal Sensei is a  nidan,( second-degree black belt) Aikikai, recognized by Hombu dojo in Japan. She began her Aikido training at Genshinkan Aikido of Manhattan, where she continues to practice under the tutelage of Gary Wagener Sensei. \"I first started Aikido because I missed being a student. I was never into martial arts, but the movement in Aikido reminded\u00a0me so much of dance that I was\u00a0immediately drawn to it. Just like in my classical dance training, the emphasis Aikido lays on very specific footwork is key. It's an Art that keeps unfolding and revealing itself, so one is a student forever!\"In addition to instructing Aikido, Mrs. Antal also operates a\u00a0successful dance studio\u00a0where she teaches ballet classes.Ian AntalInstructorChief Instructor, Genshinkan White PlainsIan Antal is a nidan (second-degree black belt) Aikikai, recognized by Hombu dojo in Japan. MrHis training began and continues at Genshinkan Aikido of Manhattan, where he served as Gary Wagener Sensei's first Soto Deshi. In 2018, Mr. Antal was bestowed the honor of opening the first satellite Genshinkan dojo in White Plains, NY where he holds the position of Chief Instructor. \"Aikido is known as the 'Art of Peace' and propagates that 'competition is self-defeating'. The paradox behind a martial art combined with a philosophy of harmony will never cease to be a source of puzzlement and fascination.\"Outside the dojo, Mr. Antal is the Executive Director of City Center Dance in White Plains, NY.",

      "main": "Gary WagenerChief Instructor/Dojo-ChoGary Wagener Sensei is a Yondan (4th degree black belt) Aikikai, recognized by Hombu dojo in Japan. The centering and harmonious aspect of daily practice is what originally and continually draws Mr. Wagener to aikido. \"After training for some time students begin to notice their everyday movements change, their breathing changes, and their daily communication changes. This injection of focused harmony and budo spirit begin to manifest itself through the understanding of aikido.\" Mr. Wagener's goal as a practitioner and instructor is to help students understand the foundations and find joy in their training.In addition to his training and instructing at Genshinkan Aikido Dojo, Mr. Wagener has taught aikido programs to underprivileged children in New York Public Schools.Robert HoffInstructorRobert Hoff Sensei is a Yondan (4th degree black belt) Aikikai, recognized by Hombu dojo in Japan. Mr. Hoff began his aikido training in Brooklyn, New York, under the instruction of Joseph Jarman Sensei. It was following an intensive period in the practice of Zen Buddhism that he became initially attracted to the art. \u201cI began training shortly after my introduction to Zen. I found in aikido a more physical and ultimately fulfilling means to similar ends \u2013 thinking and acting with compassion, existing more in the moment, being less attached to the ultimately transient nature of being. Aikido necessitates that the practitioner be supremely present, and it\u2019s that reward that sustains my practice.\u201dIn addition to his experience teaching aikido to both young people and adults, Mr. Hoff is a history teacher at a K-12 public school in Manhattan.Ariana KoblitzInstructorAriana Koblitz is a Nidan (second-degree black belt)  Aikikai, recognized by Hombu dojo in Japan.  Mrs. Koblitz joined the dojo when she first moved to New York. Training the heart, mind, and body at Genshinkan quickly became a strong base to build up from amidst the constant shifts and pivots necessary living in NYC.Each class presents a lesson she had not realized she needed that day: a nuance in body movement, posture, a clarity of mind.Ariana celebrates the principles she discovers on the mat. Be present and focus on your partner, move in harmony with them because you are both aiming for a shared outcome of peace, react only to what is presented to you with the techniques you are slowly adding to your toolbox. These provide endless inspiration for her work in experience design.Sarah AntalInstructorDojo- Cho, Genshinkan White PlainsSarah Antal Sensei is a  nidan,( second-degree black belt) Aikikai, recognized by Hombu dojo in Japan. She began her Aikido training at Genshinkan Aikido of Manhattan, where she continues to practice under the tutelage of Gary Wagener Sensei. \"I first started Aikido because I missed being a student. I was never into martial arts, but the movement in Aikido reminded\u00a0me so much of dance that I was\u00a0immediately drawn to it. Just like in my classical dance training, the emphasis Aikido lays on very specific footwork is key. It's an Art that keeps unfolding and revealing itself, so one is a student forever!\"In addition to instructing Aikido, Mrs. Antal also operates a\u00a0successful dance studio\u00a0where she teaches ballet classes.Ian AntalInstructorChief Instructor, Genshinkan White PlainsIan Antal is a nidan (second-degree black belt) Aikikai, recognized by Hombu dojo in Japan. MrHis training began and continues at Genshinkan Aikido of Manhattan, where he served as Gary Wagener Sensei's first Soto Deshi. In 2018, Mr. Antal was bestowed the honor of opening the first satellite Genshinkan dojo in White Plains, NY where he holds the position of Chief Instructor. \"Aikido is known as the 'Art of Peace' and propagates that 'competition is self-defeating'. The paradox behind a martial art combined with a philosophy of harmony will never cease to be a source of puzzlement and fascination.\"Outside the dojo, Mr. Antal is the Executive Director of City Center Dance in White Plains, NY.",

      "main": "Gary WagenerChief Instructor/Dojo-ChoGary Wagener Sensei is a Yondan (4th degree black belt) Aikikai, recognized by Hombu dojo in Japan. The centering and harmonious aspect of daily practice is what originally and continually draws Mr. Wagener to aikido. \"After training for some time students begin to notice their everyday movements change, their breathing changes, and their daily communication changes. This injection of focused harmony and budo spirit begin to manifest itself through the understanding of aikido.\" Mr. Wagener's goal as a practitioner and instructor is to help students understand the foundations and find joy in their training.In addition to his training and instructing at Genshinkan Aikido Dojo, Mr. Wagener has taught aikido programs to underprivileged children in New York Public Schools.Robert HoffInstructorRobert Hoff Sensei is a Yondan (4th degree black belt) Aikikai, recognized by Hombu dojo in Japan. Mr. Hoff began his aikido training in Brooklyn, New York, under the instruction of Joseph Jarman Sensei. It was following an intensive period in the practice of Zen Buddhism that he became initially attracted to the art. \u201cI began training shortly after my introduction to Zen. I found in aikido a more physical and ultimately fulfilling means to similar ends \u2013 thinking and acting with compassion, existing more in the moment, being less attached to the ultimately transient nature of being. Aikido necessitates that the practitioner be supremely present, and it\u2019s that reward that sustains my practice.\u201dIn addition to his experience teaching aikido to both young people and adults, Mr. Hoff is a history teacher at a K-12 public school in Manhattan.Ariana KoblitzInstructorAriana Koblitz is a Nidan (second-degree black belt)  Aikikai, recognized by Hombu dojo in Japan.  Mrs. Koblitz joined the dojo when she first moved to New York. Training the heart, mind, and body at Genshinkan quickly became a strong base to build up from amidst the constant shifts and pivots necessary living in NYC.Each class presents a lesson she had not realized she needed that day: a nuance in body movement, posture, a clarity of mind.Ariana celebrates the principles she discovers on the mat. Be present and focus on your partner, move in harmony with them because you are both aiming for a shared outcome of peace, react only to what is presented to you with the techniques you are slowly adding to your toolbox. These provide endless inspiration for her work in experience design.Sarah AntalInstructorDojo- Cho, Genshinkan White PlainsSarah Antal Sensei is a  nidan,( second-degree black belt) Aikikai, recognized by Hombu dojo in Japan. She began her Aikido training at Genshinkan Aikido of Manhattan, where she continues to practice under the tutelage of Gary Wagener Sensei. \"I first started Aikido because I missed being a student. I was never into martial arts, but the movement in Aikido reminded\u00a0me so much of dance that I was\u00a0immediately drawn to it. Just like in my classical dance training, the emphasis Aikido lays on very specific footwork is key. It's an Art that keeps unfolding and revealing itself, so one is a student forever!\"In addition to instructing Aikido, Mrs. Antal also operates a\u00a0successful dance studio\u00a0where she teaches ballet classes.Ian AntalInstructorChief Instructor, Genshinkan White PlainsIan Antal is a nidan (second-degree black belt) Aikikai, recognized by Hombu dojo in Japan. MrHis training began and continues at Genshinkan Aikido of Manhattan, where he served as Gary Wagener Sensei's first Soto Deshi. In 2018, Mr. Antal was bestowed the honor of opening the first satellite Genshinkan dojo in White Plains, NY where he holds the position of Chief Instructor. \"Aikido is known as the 'Art of Peace' and propagates that 'competition is self-defeating'. The paradox behind a martial art combined with a philosophy of harmony will never cease to be a source of puzzlement and fascination.\"Outside the dojo, Mr. Antal is the Executive Director of City Center Dance in White Plains, NY.",
